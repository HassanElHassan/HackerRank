== Task 

There are 3 urns labeled X, Z and Y.

* Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
* Urn Z contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
* Urn Y contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns.
What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

### Probability Tree Diagram
Probabilities are  multiplied along the branches of the tree diagram.

### Probability Calculation
2 out of the 3 tree diagram branches have 2 red and 1 black balls.
Add the probabilities of these 3 to get the total probability:
20/126 + 16/126 + 15/126 = 51/126 = 17/42
