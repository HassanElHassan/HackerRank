1/3

== Explanation
### Acronym used

|B  |Boy

### Experiment
The probability two children being boys given one child is a boy =  P(BB|B). +


### Sample space
there are four equally probable events:

|First child|Second child
|Boy        |Boy     
|Boy        |Girl        
|Girl       |Boy       
|Girl       |Girl     
|=============

### Event (BB and B)
That two children being boys: {{B,B}} = 1 +
The probability of this event, P(BB and B) = 1/4 +


### Event (B)
That one child is a boy out of two children: {{B,B},{B,G},{G,B}} = 3 +
The probability of this event, P(B) = 3/4

### Probability Calculation event (BB|B)
This can easily be solved using the table above. Out of the 3 posibilities of one child being a boy, only 1 is two boys, so 1/3. +

P(BB|B)= P(BB and B) / P(B) 


1/3 = 1/4 / 3/4
