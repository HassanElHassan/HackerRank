== Objective
In this challenge, we're reinforcing what we've learned on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.

== Task 

The regression line of y on x is 3x+4y+8=0, and the regression line of x on y is 4x+3y+7=0 . What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

== Solution 

-3/4

== Explanation

=== Concise
* Multiply equations for the slope(b) that make use of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient(r):
** b~xy~ = r(σ~y~/σ~x~) and b~yx~ = r(σ~x~/σ~y~) -> r^2^ = b~xy~b~yx~

* Rewrite both regression lines to get the slope(b) for each:
** 3x+4y+8 = 0 -> y = -3/4x-2 -> b = -3/4
** 4x+3y+7 = 0 -> x = -3/4y-7/4 -> b = -3/4

* Calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient(r):
** r^2^ = b~xy~b~yx~ = -3/4 x -3/4 = 9/16 
** slopes are negative so the value of r will be negative -> r = -3/4

=== Step by Step

===== step1: multiply equations for slope
* One of the equations used to calculate the slope(b) of a regression line is:
** b = r(σ~y~/σ~x~)

* The slope(b) for both regression lines is known from the task, so we can rewrite this equations to be able to calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient(r):
** r = b(σ~y~/σ~x~) -> b = r /(σ~y~/σ~x~) -> b = (rσ~x~)/σ~y~

* multiply the slope equation of both regression lines:
** cancel/strike out the standard deviations as they are the same in both the numerator and denominator
** b~xy~b~yx~ = ((rσ~x~)/σ~y~)((rσ~y~)/σ~x~) = (r^2^σ~x~σ~y~)/(σ~y~σ~x~) = r^2^

===== step2: rewrite regression line
* Rewrite both regression lines to get the slope(b) for each:
** regression line of y on x
*** 3x+4y+8 = 0 -> 3x+8 = 0-4y -> 3x+8 = -4y -> (3x+8)/-4 = -4y/-4 -> 3x/-4+8/-4 = -4y/-4 -> y = -3/4x+-2
*** b=-3/4
** regression line of x on y
*** 4x+3y+7 = 0 -> 3y+7 = 0-4x -> 3y+7 = -4x -> (3y+7)/-4 = -4x/-4 -> 3y/-4+7/-4 = -4y/-4 -> y = -3/4x+-7/4
*** b=-3/4

===== step3: calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient
* Use the equation created in step1 to calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient(r):
** r^2^ = b~xy~b~yx~ = -3/4 x -3/4 = 9/16
** r^2^ = 9/16 -> r = sqrt(9/16) = 3/4
** the r indicated the correclation between two variables
** positive and negative r values respectively indicate a positive and a negative linear correlation
** the b value indicates the steepness of the line
** both the r and b values indicate as well the direction of the line
*** positive values -> line is increasing -> line goes up from left to right
*** negative values -> line is decreasing -> line goes down from left to right
** so both r and b must have the same sign (+ or -)
** slopes are negative so the value of r will be negative -> -3/4
