== Solution 

5/6

== Explanation

### Experiment 
A single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice. 

### Sample Space (S) 
The possible outcomes for the toss of 1 die are {1,2,3,4,5,6}. As our experiment tosses 2 dice, we have to consider all possible toss outcomes by finding the Cartesian Product of the possible outcomes for each die: S= {{1,2,3,4,5,6}X{1,2,3,4,5,6}} = (6x6) = 36. 

### Event (A and B)
That the sum is at most 9. + 
It's easier to note the events that don't meet the criteria, where the sum is higher than 9: {{5,5},{4,6},{5,6},{6,6},{6,5},{6,4}} = 6. +
All the remaning events will be the events where the sum is at most 9: 36-6= 30

### Probability
30/36 = 5/6
