== Solution 

1/9

== Explanation

*Experiment:* +
A single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice. +

*Sample Space (S):* +
The possible outcomes for the toss of 1 die are {1,2,3,4,5,6}. As our experiment tosses 2 dice, we have to consider all possible toss outcomes by finding the Cartesian Product of the possible outcomes for each die: S= {{1,2,3,4,5,6}X{1,2,3,4,5,6}} = (6x6) = 36. +

*Event (A and B):* + 
That the values rolled by each die is different and the two dice have a sum of 6: {{4,2},{5,1},{2,4},{1,5}} = 4 +

*Probability:* +
4/36 = 2/18 = 1/9
