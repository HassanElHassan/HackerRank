== 10 Days of Statistics
* https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-statistics["10 Days of Statistics", window=”_blank”] on HackerRank.
* https://github.com/HassanElHassan/HackerRank/tree/master/10%20Days%20of%20Statistics["Solutions", window=”_blank”] on GitHub.
* All coding solution are done using Python3(.py) and R(.R).
* All text solutions are done using Asciidoc(.adoc).
* Due to the nature of Python and R the majority of these challenges could easily be solved using built-in functions or libraries, to keep it a challenge, these were avoided.
